# Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World

## Key Takeaways
- Get comfortable with boredom. Don't distract yourself with your phone every time you have to wait for 5 min.
- Incomplete tasks dominate our attention. At the end of the workday, write out what you will do for that task the next day. Then you have a plan and know that every task is covered.
- Identify target for attention when working.

## Feedback

The main point Deep Work made is to remove distractions and seriously focus on your work. Turn off your phone, seclude yourself in a room, close your email, and concentrate on the task in hand. If you are 
unable to restrict yourself this much due to your work responsibilities, try to get as close to this as you can.

Overall, the book offered pretty good advice and provided actionable steps. It gets a B.
