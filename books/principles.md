## Summary
This is a type of a book everyone should read. Ray Dalio teaches us how to be more “successful” by being open-minded, focused, and hard-working. You can apply these lessons to any virtue you pursue because they are general, yet important. It is crucial to keep learning, take action (and learn from it), face problems head-on, and try to get to the truth.

“Principles” also describes many management techniques one can use in their company to assign people to positions that fit them best and make sure that everyone is doing tasks aligned with their strength.
