# Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning
## Key Takeaways:
- The most effective learning comes from information retrieval, such as quizzes, tests, retelling in your own words, or teaching someone. Rereading books, notes, and lectures is very ineffective. The harder you think during
retrieval, the better information will stick.
- Mixing up problem topic slows initial learning, but allows information to stick a lot better. If you only solve problems from one topic at a time, you will anticipate them and not learn as well.
- To allow information to move to long term memory, you need to practice spaced retrieval - revisit the topic regularly.

## Feedback:
I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is engaged in large quantities of learning: school, college, course, specialization. It gives practical advice on how to learn efficiently. Previously, I have found myself 
spending lots of time closely reading textbooks and watching long lecture style videos and trying to memorize information. After reading this book I have realized that I should use textbooks and videos to find what information
I need to know and where it is. The real learning comes from solving problems and tests. When I run into something unfamiliar in a problem, I go back to the text or the video and specifically look for the information.

"Make It Stick" deserves an A.
