# Adaptive Markets: Financial Evolution at the Speed of Thought
## Key Takeaways:
- Humans use probability matching, which is often irrational. For example, when making March Madness brackets, people often will not pick all four number one seeds to win their first game. Their reasoning is that typically only two or three of them win in the first round. However, they do not know which one will lose. Thus, they should asses each game individually and pick the higher probability winner, which is the number one seed.

  To help understand this concept, lets take a look at a roulette table that shows red 75% of the time and black 25% of the time. If you were to bet 20 times, would you bet 20 times on red or 15 on red and 5 on black? Of course 20 times on red. You would not probability match.

## Feedback:
The book seemed interesting, however it was very long and didn't really drive any particular point home. The author simply wandered around and kept throwing ideas, without providing any actual good takeaways or actionable advice.

"Adaptive Markets" pretty much followed a pattern: "Are markets efficient? This person said they are. But Warren Buffett and Jim Simons were able to make a lot of money with their hedge funds. Were they lucky or were they skilled?
There are a lot of people trying to get above market returns in an ocean of assets. Markets are better explained by biology than physics. Let's take a look at this species. They adapted to their environment. But when the environment
changed, they went extinct. So markets adapt to the environment and evolve at the speed of thought. Now let's talk about the 2008 crash. Asset managers were taking excessive risk. They should be penalized for that..."

As you can see, there are interesting ideas and topics. However, I feel like there were no conclusions to any of the discussion and I barely learned anything. I don't even know whether the author thinks that the markets are efficient or not.

*Adaptive Markets* gets a D.
