## Feedback
Wow. I have read a little over 100 books over the last 5 years. This is the first time I binge-read a book. It was so engaging, I could not stop listening. It is absolutely incredible that a
person like David Goggins can show us that no matter how shitty your situation is, you can always work hard and give yourself the best chance of succeeding. Because guess what, nobody is coming to save you!

The book is very motivational. But that doesn't really matter. As I said before (and as Goggins) mentioned, motivation comes and goes. The number one reason that everyone who is trying to better themselves should read this 
is because David shows us that our minds are capable of WAY more than we think. When you are feeling down, tired, or burned out, imagine yourself running a race. If you stop studying/working, or skip your workout,
it is equivalent to stopping and quitting that race. And the worst part is you KNOW that you can keep going. Next time your mind tells you "You are tired", "You should take a break", or when you inevitably face the dreaded
question "Why?", "Why are you doing this?", you will think of this book and keep going instead of negotiating with your mind.

Incredibly engaging book with life-changing lessons. Deserves an A.
