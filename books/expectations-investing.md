# Expectations Investing: Reading Stock Prices for Better Returns
## Key Takeaways
- In order to invest well, not only do you have to pick a company that is having a return greater than cost of capital, but their stock price has to be at a discount.
- During a period of increasing demand, a company that is building additional capacity (factories) will capture the extra demand and returns compared to other companies. However, if all companies increase capacity, their returns will stay the same and then drop when demand goes down.
## Grading
Expectations Investing has great insight on methods of evaluating companies. It breaks down the factors very well and provides concrete examples to show how those factors could affect the price. In addition to simply giving stock evaluating techniques, it gives a couple of memorable, foundational investing principles. Content gets an A.

The text was pretty dry, more textbook style. Thus, I did not expect writing to be very engaging. However, it was not too boring. Writing gets a C.
## Summary
The main point Expectations Investing tries to convey is identifying the main operating value driver. Then determining how various events, such as earnings, stock buybacks, mergers and acquisitions, etcâ€¦ affect that driver. After identifying the main value driver and building a discounted cash flow model, the book teaches to find the expected value of the price. In order to find the expected value, we have to weight possible outcomes and determine how much each would affect the price. Completing the calculation should give us the implied expected price.

My biggest takeaway from the book is that not only do you have to find a company who has a greater return than its cost of capital, but you have to find a company whos stock is undervalued.
