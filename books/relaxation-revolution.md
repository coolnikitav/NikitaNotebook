# Relaxation Revolution
## Key Takeaways:
- Placebo is very powerful, has been proven to work, and can be used to treat a lot of diseases and pain.
- Try out Dr Benson's Relaxation Response technique.

## Feedback:
Some books implement repetition to emphasize the main point of the book and ensure that the reader remembers it. Relaxation Revolution repeated the same 20 minutes of content for 6 hours. It became a very boring read after
the author repeated himself for the 3rd time. 

The book consisted of the author explaining what relaxation response is, how it works, and then proving that placebo is effective with tons of examples. The relaxation response approach sounds useful and I will be trying it out
to see if it benefits my life in any way. If it does, then I suppose the book offers some valuable information.

*Relaxation Revolution* deserves a D. It was repetitive, boring, and I'm not completely sure how effective their teachings are. You do not need to ready the book, simply look up "Benson-Henry relaxation response".
