# Competitive Advantage: Creating and Sustaining Superior Performance

## Key Takeaways:
- You must pick one of the following strategies: cost leadership, differentiation, or focus. You will fail if you do not pick one and stay in the middle.
- Differentiation does not lead to superior performance if its perceived value to the buyer does not exceed cost.
- Competitors can be good or bad. Bad competitors sabotage their margins and the industry or look incompetent. Good competitors help the entire industry grow and your company improve and innovate.

## Grading:
I found that Michael E. Porter’s book contains a wealth of insightful advice on running and expanding a business. 
The book’s content is highly pertinent and practical, particularly for top-level executives. 
However, I observed that the advice provided is not groundbreaking or transformative, resulting in a content rating of B.

Furthermore, the book’s writing style is rather dry and textbook-like, which may not appeal to all readers. 
The frequent repetition of terminologies such as “cost” and “differentiation” can also become tedious. 
Consequently, I assigned a writing quality rating of D to the book.
