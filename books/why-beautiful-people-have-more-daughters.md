# Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters
## Key Takeaways:
- Men and women have the same number of kids on average. However, there are a lot more men than women who have no kids, and a lot more men than women who have lots of kids. Men can potential have thousands of kids, while
  women can only have tens.
- Beauty standards are universal, contrary to a belief that they are forced upon us by the Western media. This was tested in studies with thousands on participants from all over the world. In addition, this was tested
  on 1 week old infants, who cannot have been swayed by the Western media.
- People don't learn to be racist and ethnocentric through socialization, they learn how not to be. All humans are born with a preference for their own kind. They learn to put those biases aside as the grow up.

## Feedback
I find evolution psychology books to be very interesting. "Why Beautiful People Have More Daughters" was an engaging read. The author discussed controversial topics by providing good reasoning and backing his claims up with studies.
This book can definitely open some good conversations.

There are a lot of good points made about the differences between men and women, as well as differences between countries, cultures, and even species. However, one needs to be careful and do their own research as they are reading the book.
For example, the author makes several claims along the lines of "Rich people have more boys because it is more advantageous for a man than for a woman to have more resources". He backs this claim up with a study, where
58% of kids of rich people observed were boys. While it is generally true that it is more advantageous for a male than a female to have lots of resources to attract a mate, there is simply no proof that your posessions can
have any effect on your genes and on the gender of your offspring. Thus, I cannot accept this argument because the authors evidence is not sufficient.
