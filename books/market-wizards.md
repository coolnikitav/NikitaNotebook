# Market Wizards: Interviews With Top Traders

## Grading
Market Wizards introduces us to various approaches successful traders use and rules they follow. The content is good, especially for a new trader. However, the biggest problem with the book is that all of the interviews are with professionals who traded in 1960s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. Even though the general lessons still apply today, a lot of specifics are outdated. It has been increasingly difficult to trade with rise of quantum and computer trading, so I am not sure how seriously the reader should take the book. Content gets a C.

The writing is pretty clear. Trading rules and strategies are pretty easy to follow. However, the book did not need to be this long. The same lessons could have been conveyed in a more efficient manner.

## Summary
Jack Schwager has picked a wide variety of traders to show that there are plenty of strategies out there that would allow a person to be successful. It is not about picking the best strategy, but the one that suits you the best. Some of the successful interviewed traders hold their trades for half and hour, some hold them for years. Some only use technical analysis, some only use fundamental, and some use both. Some trader stocks, some trade futures, some trade currencies. The goal is to find a system that you are comfortable with.

Even though of the interviewed traders use different strategies, they all show common character traits and follow similar rules. All of them can admit that they are wrong, prioritize making money over protecting their ego, work very hard and are always learning. When it comes to trading, all of them let their winners ride and cut losers short, decrease trading size when on a losing streak and are feeling less confident, know when they will exit a trade before entering, have very disciplined risk control.
