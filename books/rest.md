I work and study a lot. However, it gets difficult to focus and stay fresh. This book teaches you how to actively rest to recover from your work, becoming more productive and yielding better results when you get
back to work. I have always thought that the best way to rest was to put everything away and just sit there and relax. However, we can see from research that the best way to rest after doing one task is to do another task.
I have started to implement this approach at work and it is very effective. After doing focused work, I play some chess, do duolingo, or go on a walk. The activity does need to be interesting for you, but not too challenging.

It also looks like all successful and productive people have a routine that they follow almost every day. That routine has focused work, active rest, and proper sleep. Without the latter two, you will burn out and
combust in flames if you work non-stop. 

*Rest* should be read by anyone who would want to become more productive, while enjoying their life at the same time.
