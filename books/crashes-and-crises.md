# Crashes and Crises: Lessons from a History of Financial Disasters
## Grading
Crashes and Crises covers many main financial disasters over the last four hundred years, starting with the tulip bubble and ending with Chinaâ€™s shadow bank and real estate problem. Each disaster was covered in great detail with accurate facts. The author clearly lays out the causes and effects of the crashes. However, a lot of times it is difficult to determine the main takeaway from the chapter. It makes the crashes each memorable, as it is hard to remember every detail.

The writing was clear and straight to the point. All of the material was related directly to the financial disasters. However, it is hard to understand the chapters without advanced finance knowledge. The author goes at a high pace and uses tons of financial terminology. It can be difficult to follow for new listeners.

## Summary
All crashes and crises come in cycles: someone promises high returns, everyone tries to get in on the ride, everyone suspects fraud, the system cracks, everyone tries to get out, and the system collapses. However, the causes of such crashes are different. Some start with purely fraudulent behavior. Someone just tries to scam people by running a Ponzi scheme. Some are caused by events that are hard to control, such as war. Many occur due to new unregulated investment vehicles emerging. Others occur due to everyone trying to chase a profit opportunity, resulting in bubbles.

Many times the fault is not only on the individuals who started the crash, but also on regulators who did not oversee the operations correctly and let the situation spiral out of control.
