## Feedback
I wanted to get better at speaking and storytelling to convey my thoughts more effectively. *Wired for Story* seemed like a good choice. A couple of chapters in, I realized the book is more
for writes wanting to write a full story. The advice in the book would probably help such writer. However, the content was more textbook style. It primarily sited the methods great authors used in their novels.
I do not find such approach very effective. If you were bad at dribbling a basketball, watching Lebron James highlights would be terribly ineffective in helping you improve.

The book had prety monotone advice that I did not find very useful. I couldn't even come up with any key takeaways. Thus, *Wired For Story* gets a D.
