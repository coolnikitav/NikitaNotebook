I have always wondered why some nations are so poor, while others are so prosperous. I thought the main reasons were because people in other places simply don't work
as hard and do not have as many resources as us. However, "Why Nations Fail" points to the root of the problem and provides an abundant amount of resources to support
its claims.

The main reason why nations fail is because they have extractive economic and political institutions. The elites want to stay in power. Thus, they rig the system, 
preventing regular people from enriching themselves. There are numerous ways of achieving them: ridiculous taxing systems (up to 90% for common citizens!), 
rigged elections, absence of property rights or even a lot of the human rights in some places, forced labor and slavery, government owned assets, bribing in politics,
and others. 

If we were to think about the effect it has on a countries population, it is clear: besides horrible living standards, people do not have
insentives to produce anything. Why would they? If they somehow make money, the government will just take it away. If they somehow get into 
high political ranks and oppose the government they will be killed. 

Extractive political institutions enrich themselves at the cost of their people. This is why the presidents and the government elite live so lavishly. "Why Nations
Fail" provides numerours examples to support these claims, looking at countries like North Korea, Argentina, Zimbabwe, Eastern Europre during the dark ages, the 
Soviet Union, and others (I don't remember the names of all of the countries and islands).

If a country wants to prosper, it needs to have inclusive economic and political institutions. People need to have enforced human and property rights. People should 
have incentives and be rewarded for their work. There need to be free and fair elections. The media needs to keep the government accountable, instead of colluding 
with it.

In my opinion, United States is still the examplary nation to the rest of the world. It has law and order, freedoms, enforced human and property rights, equality, and
inclusive political and economic institutions (anyone can get rich and get elected, even though its more difficult for some than others). However, there are downsides
as well. There is a great amount of regulatory capture in the pharmaceutical, military, and telecommunications industries. The companies in that sphere and basically
monopolies. They are the biggest donors for the government, as well as the biggest customers for the media. Thus, the government AND the media both have to do what
they say. The prices for their products are insane (compared with other countries). On top of that, there has barely been any innovation over the last two decades.
This HAS to be fixed.

Overall, the book is pretty good. I think you should read it. I am not sure how biased the author is though. It gets a B.
