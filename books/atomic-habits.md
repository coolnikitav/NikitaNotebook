# Atomic Habits: An Easy & Proven Way to Build Good Habits & Break Bad Ones
## Key Takeaways:
- We all have different genes. Work hard at things that come easy.
- Make good habits easy and bad habits hard.

## Feedback.
This is a book EVERYONE should read. Or at least everyone who doesn't have the perfect discipline (which is 99% of people). There is a lot of general advice out there. 
"Don't be lazy". "Achieve your goals". "Just do it". Willpower is a finite resource. And if you don't change the environment around you to make good habits easy and bad habits hard,
you will run out of willpower way before you can even think of achieving your goals.

Motivation is bullshit. It comes and goes. This book will teach you how to build discipline and make your habits routine. It is also well-written and pleasant to read/listen.

*Atomic habits* undoubtedly deserves an A.
