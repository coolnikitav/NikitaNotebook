# Liar's Poker

## Grading
Michael Lewis is a great writer and narrator (I have listened to his podcast). I greatly enjoyed his writing style. He describes some of the trades everyone made, but mostly focused on stories, describing the life of a financial banker at Salomon Brothers in 1980. He made the job sound fun and the life of an investment banker exciting, full of ups and downs. Writing gets an A.

I did not enjoy the content nearly as much. If you are looking for an engaging fun story to listen to, this book is for you. There is very little content to learn from. Michael Lewis mentions a couple of trades he made and gave his reasoning sparingly. But during his recent podcast with traders, you can see that Wall Street today is very different from what it was 40 years ago. Content gets a D.

## Summary
Salomon Brothers was a very prosperous investment bank in the 1980s. Many bankers and traders were making hundreds of thousands of dollars in their mid-twenties. Michael Lewis describes the work environment to be pretty hostile. Trainees went through a good amount of hazing. Most of the money was made through fees. It sounded like the investment bankers were just salespeople trying to sell garbage to their clients to book a fee for themselves. A lot of actual trades were made through market manipulation (Salomon Brothers using very large positions to move the market) and some insider information.
