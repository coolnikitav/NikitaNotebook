# Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind

## Key Takeaways:
- Technology doesn't save us time and doesn't make our lifes easier. It simply allows us to get more done.
- When empires were around, credit utilization was low and people didn't think to increase production. Thus, they spent excess money on beautiful buildings, concerts, and other projects. Nowadays, excess money is spent on increasing production (hiring more workers, building more factories).
- Nowadays, wars are becoming less profitable and peace more profitable because of international trade and knowledge based economy.

## Feedback:
I got a little bit bored in the beginning. It seemed like the entire book will be about our ancestors who lived tens of thousands of years ago. However, the book quickly started advancing through our evolution.
It described how we developed and started dominating our surroundings. Then talked about the agricultural revolution, societies, empires, and so on. Yuval Noah Harari even got to the present times and his prediction for
the future, perfectly rounding up this story. 

My favorite chapter was on capitalism and European curiosity. It was different from previous empires and societies, which allowed Europe to become the most dominant region within 200 years. We can see how capitalism, greed, 
and expansionism benefits society and accelerates progress.

*Sapiens* is a book that everyone should definitely read. It explains human psychology, the ways societies form and interact, and the reasons for our current state of the world.
Reading this was an eye opening experience.
