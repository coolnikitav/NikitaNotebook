# Equity Research Report – Acme United Corporation (ACU)

## Rating
The rating for this company was not determined. After conducting a DCF analysis, the implied share price came out to be negative. ACME United has negative cash flows due to their high costs and small profits (net income is <5% of revenue) and slow inventory turnover (days inventory outstanding is 170).

At this point in my finance journey, I do not have the tools to evaluate a company with a negative share price. I will not be placing a “buy” or a “sell” rating.

Both present and expected free cash flows resulted in being negative, leading to a negative implied share price. ACME United has high COGS (>50% of revenue) and high operating expenses (>30% of revenue). This results in a low profit margin of below 5%. Additionally, ACME has great difficulty selling its inventory, resulting in DIO of 170 days. It is greater than the industry average of 150 days.

## Catalysts
If fed interest rate hikes do not break the back of inflation. ACME’s costs will rise even further. Given their minimal profit margin, they will not be able to make money on the products they sell. This would result in a “sell” rating on this stock.
