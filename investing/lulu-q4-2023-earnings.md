# Lululemon Outlook Update
## Results (as of 3/30/2023)
Investment into Lululemon was made on 8/5/2022 at the price of $309. Since then, LULU has had a return of 16% (current price of $359). SPY has had a return of -2.2%. Lululemon had a successful Q4 earnings report on March 28. Earnings per share and revenue exceeded expectations and provided optimistic guidance for the coming year. As a result, the stock rose 14%. Lululemon is getting better than expected sales in a period of economic downturn. It has a very strong brand, which can perform well even when people tend to buy fewer luxury goods. In addition, they were able to sell a lot of their inventory, even though it was done through discounting.

My outlook on Lululemon remains positive as it is strengthening its brand and successfully selling premium products in a period of economic distress.
