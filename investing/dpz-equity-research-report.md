Domino’s had great free cash flow numbers, resulting in an implied share price of $1195.49, a 350% upside from the current price of $360. However, large amount of debt can pose difficulties in the coming decade, as interest rates rise and interest payments increase.

## Catalysts

1. If interest payments become unmanageable, Domino’s will have to finance through equity, decrease free cash flow numbers, negatively impacting the price.
2. If the recession in the US is worse than predicted, demand for pizza should rise relatively to many other goods, as it is on the border between a normal and an interior good. Demand for higher end restaurants will fall and demand for cheaper carry-out pizza will rise. This will result in the stock outperforming the overall stock market.
