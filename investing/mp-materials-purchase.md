# MP Materials Purchase

## Results (as of 11/12/2022)
Majority of my MP position was purchase on 08/03/2022. Since then, MP has a return of 1%. SPY has a return of -2.9% since then. From my observations, MP has had a low correlation with the S&P500 over this period. There were a handful of days where S&P500 is up and MP is down and vice versa. There have also been days where MP was up or down significantly more than S&P500.

MP Materials had a great Q3 earnings report on November 3, 2022. Stock price went up 8.5%. Revenue and profit numbers grew year-over-year and beat analysts estimates. Production volume slipped 9%. However, increase in prices of rare earth metals compensated for the drop. In addition, MP has started Stage II – a plan to improve their mining practice. If it succeed, it will have a great payoff. However, it is a capital intensive project, which will hurt the company’s balance sheet if it does not go as planned.

## Background
The electric vehicle industry has grown significantly in the last decade. It will keep growing as many of the traditional car manufacturers are starting to release electric vehicles. Ford even separated their company into two segments: a traditional and an EV one.

One of the most important feature of an electric vehicle is its battery. The battery is made out of various rare earth metals. These rare earth metals are mined all over the globe.

## Reasoning
The electric vehicle market is projected to grow almost five fold from 2021 to 2028. Thus, demand for rare earth metals will significantly increase. MP Materials mined 15% of world’s rare earth metals in 2021. One of those metals is Neodymium-Praseodymium – a key element used in EV batteries.

Overwhelming majority of rare earth metals is mined in China and Russia, typically in very bad conditions. On the other hand, MP Materials has the only integrated rare earth mining and processing site in North America, operating under high standards. Recently, our government has been showing support American businesses and has been trying to reduce dependence on foreign sources. I think that our government will support our mining facilities in the future or help them get through tough times.

I have always noticed that the leader of the business is extremely important. James Litinsky is a Yale graduate and founder of JHL Capital Group, LLC. He purchased the company in 2017, after it went bankrupt in 2015. He built it from the ground up and started making profit as of last year. Mr Litinsky is a smart and experienced founder, who will lead this company in a good direction.

Lastly, the company has been public for two years. The second year it tripled its revenues and had positive net income, which is hard to achieve for a younger company.

## Risks

Rare earth metals have significantly increased in price in the last year. This is one of the causes for increased earnings. MP Materials is also priced a bit higher than its competitors. Its P/E ratio is higher than industry’s.
