## Results (as of 3/8/2023)

Majority of my MP position was purchased on 08/03/2022. Since then, MP Materials has had a return of -7.8%. SPY has had a return of -3.3%. Most recent price update was on March 2, 2023. During their investor day, Tesla announced that their new batteries will not be using rare earth metals. It is a big hit for MP materials because the increase in future demand was mainly expected due to increase in the number of electric vehicles. If more EV companies end their reliance on rare earth metals, the sales expectations of MP Materials will be drastically revised downward.

Recent earnings report brought positive news. Revenue, production, and sales volume were all up and beat expectations.
