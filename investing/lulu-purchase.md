# LULU Purchase

## Results (as of 12/8/2022)
My first investment into LULU was made on 08/05/2022. Since then LULU has gone up 16.24%, while SPY is down 2.7%. Typically, over the last 3 month, LULU has been outperforming SPY on green days and dropping by the same amount on red days.

Lululemon announced q3 earnings on December 8, 2022. All of the typical metrics, such as revenue, profits, inventories rose by about 25%, keeping pace with the growth rate over the past couple of years. Recession and inflation fears and not impacting LULU’s demand. Guidance was worse than expected, but by a very slim margin. Q4 EPS is expected to be between $4.2 and $4.3 instead of projected $4.3. Q4 revenue is expected to be between $2.605 billion and $2.655 billion, instead of projected $2.649 billion. Stock has dropped 7% on the earnings news due to guidance. Considering strong growth and marginal decrease and guidance, I think that it is a good buy opportunity.

Lululemon had a great quarter 2 earnings report on September 1. Stock price went up 10%. Revenue, profit, EPS, and many other metrics grew year-over-year and beat analyst estimates. Demand for their clothing is still up despite slowing economy.

## Background
Financial statement analysis is quite important in investing. I recently read “Warren Buffett and the Interpretation of Financial Statements”. He describes what he looks for when looking at income statement, balance sheet, and cashflow statements. Analyzing financial statements helps him determine a company with a long-term competitive advantage.

Additionally, I was looking at points where Warren Buffett bought his large stakes in Coca-Cola and Apple. Below you can see how both charts looked when he purchased.

As you can see, these companies weren’t failing or even staying at the same level. They were growing and generating cash flow.

## Reasoning

After analyzing various stocks, I came across Lululemon. Their chart was showing great growth.

They are a growing company and have an established worldwide brand. It is hard to assess value of a brand name, but Lululemon is able to charge premium prices and get many people to buy their products. I would say their brand is pretty strong. Additionally, they started getting into the sports industry. When you go into a merch store of a football or a basketball team, you will see Lululemon clothing alongside with Nike, Under Armour, or Adidas.

Now, most importantly, I analyzed their financial statement and compared them to the standard Warren Buffett is looking for. In the following table I will compare the goal results with Lululemon’s statements over the last 8 years.

### Income Statement
| | Warren Buffett | Lululemon |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Gross Profit | Above 40% | Around 50% |
| SG&A | Consistency is the most important! | Consistently around 60% of Gross Profit |
| R&D | The lower the better, means less risk of failure | No R&D costs |
| Depreciation| Less than 10% of Gross Profit | 0.2% |
| Interest Expense | 	Less than 15% of Operating Income | None |
| Net Earnings | Upward trend, above industry average | Upward trend, same as industry average of 11% |
| Per-Share Earnings | Upward trend | Upward trend |

### Balance Sheet
| | Warren Buffett | Lululemon |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Cash and Cash Eq. | Upward trend | Strong upward trend |
| Inventory | Rise of inventory and net earnings | Rise of inventory and net earnings |
| Intangible Assets | Good brand name that came from internal development | Good brand name that came from internal development |
| Long-Term Investments | Invest in other companies with durable competitive advantages | No investments |
| Short-Term Debt | Less short-term debt than long-term debt | $0.2 in short-term debt for each $1 in long-term debt |
| Long-Term Debt | Have enough earning power for pay off in one to three years | Can pay off all of their long-term debt with earnings from one year |
| Total Liabilities and the Debt to Shareholder’s Equity Ratio | Debt to Shareholders’ Equity Ratio of less than 0.8 | Around a 0.3 ratio |
| Preferred and Common Stock | The less preferred stock the better | No preferred stock |
| Retained Earnings | Upward trend | Strong upward trend |
| Treasury Stock | 	Buying back shares is preferred | They have been buying back their stock |

### Cash Flow Statement
| | Warren Buffett | Lululemon |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| CapEx | Less than 50% of net earnings | About 40% |
| Stock Buybacks | Good companies tend to buyback their stock | Have been buying back stock every year |

As seen from the analysis above, Lululemon hits every metric Warren Buffett is looking for in a company with long term durable advantage. It has increasing earnings, great margins, not much debt, and is buying back its stock. Combining this with a strong brand makes me believe that it is a good company with a long-term competitive advantage.

## Risks
I think that Lululemon is a good company. However, even good companies can be overpriced. Currently, I am not verse with price evaluation model. Thus, I cannot say if the company is over, under, or fairly valued. However, the stock market is down more than 20% from its peak. So, I think that the probability of it overvalued is less than of it being fairly or undervalue. Again, I could be wrong.

I have always heard that you need to have a circle of competence and only invest in what you know. I am not that familiar with the clothing and athletic apparel industry. I did compare Lululemon’s financial statement with Nike’s and found that they are either the same or better in each category.
