# LULU DCF Analysis
## Results
After completing the DCF analysis, I have found that the share price of Lululemon should be $125. Currently, Lululemon is at $325. According to the analysis, the company is overvalued and should not be invested in. However, I will keep my LULU investment because this is my first DCF analysis and it is a company with great financials and a strong brand name.

The spreadsheet is attached below:

## Background
I have made a couple of purchases of Lululemon stock over the past couple of months after analyzing their financial statements. Financial statements showed a healthy company. In combination with their strong brand, I deemed LULU a good investment. However, one of the concerns was the price shares were purchased at. Since I did not know any valuation models, I could not determine whether the price was fair.

Discounted cash flow analysis is one of the most popular valuation methods. I decided to learn it and apply this model to Lululemon.

## Data
The DCF model is started by importing and formatting the financial statements: income statement, balance sheet, and cash flows.

Lululemon’s financials have been increasing at a pretty steady rate since 2013. Thus, I will be using the data since 2013.

## Free Cash Flow Projections
There are 10 years of steadily growing financials in Lululemon’s statements. I decided to do projections for the next 5 years. Usually, DCF projections are for the next 5 to 10 years. I think that 5 years fits better because the economy is about to change drastically. Since 2009, interest rates have been at 0%. They will be at around 4-5% for the coming years.

### Projected Free Cash Flow:
All of the actual numbers were filled in from the financial statements. Projections for COGS, SG&A, and Tax are averages of the past 10 years. The average revenue growth over the same period is 18.7%. Lululemon has surpassed its industry average of 4.2% (Source). High-growth companies usually slow down as they mature, so Lululemon’s revenue growth will probably slow over the coming years. I used the average of Lululemon’s and the industry’s revenue growth rate of 11.45%.

Projected D&A and CapEx were calculated in Projected Fixed Assets.

Projected changes in NWC, current assets, and current liabilities were calculated in Projected Net Working Capital. The projected NWC turned out to be a lot lower than NWC over the past 10 years. This is due to the approach used in the tutorial.

Unlevered cash flow in 2023 (the first projected year) is very high. This is due to the fact that there was a drastic change in net working capital from the previous actual amount due to the approach.

### Projected Fixed Assets:

Projections for D&A and CapEx as % of Beginning PP&E are averages over the past 10 years.

### Projected Net Working Capital:
This page utilized some of the current assets and current liabilities. I followed a tutorial to complete this DCF analysis. I am not sure why only some of the current assets and some of the current liabilities were chosen and I do not know how they were selected. As I gain experience, I will find it out.

Days sales and days inventory outstanding are consistent over the last 10 years. The projections will be the average of the period. Days payable outstanding have greatly increased in the last 4 years. Thus, projections will be based on the last 4-year average.

Other current assets as % of revenue have significantly decreased over the last 3 years. Projections are based on the last 5-year average.

Accrued compensation, unredeemed gift card liability, and other current liabilities are consistent, so projections are based on the last 10-year average.

### Weighted Average Cost of Capital:
Lululemon does not have any long-term debt. It finances all of its activities through equity.

I assumed an expected market return of 7.8%.

Lululemon’s beta is 1.28.
### DCF:
The growth rate chosen is 4.2%, which is the growth rate of the sports apparel industry.

Perpetuity growth method was used to find the terminal value of the company:

### Notes
This is my first time doing a DCF Model. I am pretty sure I did not use the proper value to calculate projected net working capital, as I was following a pretty general tutorial. Additionally, I did not have various cases (best, middle, and worst) in this DCF. As I gain experience, I will learn how to evaluate various cases based on the business model of a company and the economy of our country.
