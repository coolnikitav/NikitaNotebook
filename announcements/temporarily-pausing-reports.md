# Temporarily pausing equity research report releases

I have been posting equity research reports for the past 7 month. I have enjoyed analyzing companiesâ€™ financial statements, projecting their future cash flows, and arriving at an intrinsic value. I always wanted to see if I can get close to the market price and then find why I was off, whether it was my miscalculation or whether I thought there is an actual trade opportunity.

There will be a pause in the research report releases because I am busy working on personal engineering projects (later I will make an engineering page for the website).These engineering projects take a considerable amount of time and effort. In addition, they provide a much greater return on investment (my time) at this moment. I work as a software engineer for an engineering company. Most of my friends are engineers. It is much more practical and beneficial for me to absorb all of the knowledge I have around me to learn from actual experience I get at work and during personal projects.

I enjoy working on the research reports. However, that the benefit is very minimal. I do not have access to adequate resources or a convenient way to get feedback. This makes it very hard to improve.
