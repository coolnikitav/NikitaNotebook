I have been using Bluehost and Wordpress in the past year. These tools create a decent looking website. However, they are pretty difficult and tedious to use.

Since I started working, I have gotten a lot more exprience with github. It is much more convenient to use, which saves me time. Additionally, I can easily upload code for my engineering projects.
