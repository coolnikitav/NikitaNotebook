# Welcome to my notebook!

I am constantly learning, reading, and working on new projects. I post some of my reports and biggest takeaways here to act as a well of knowledge for future engineers and people who want to get better every day.

The most active channel so far is about books. You can check out the book reviews in the [book-feed](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/book-feed.md). I started reading in 2017, but started doing book reviews in 2022. So a lot
 of the books do not have a review. I hope this is 
a good starting point for people getting into reading. You can check out the best books I have read. Save yourself some time searching and going through the junk!

[trading-feed](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/trading-feed.md) is for my trades, strategies, and results.

[investing-feed](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/investing-feed.md) is for my investments and company valuations. I have paused posting to this feed for now
because I have virtually no resources that can help me improve. It is much more practical for me to focus on furthering my engineering knowledge.

[announcement-feed](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/announcement-feed.md) is where I will announce when I make new posts or when there are changes to the content format.

Corrections, criticism, and topic discussions are welcomed!
