## Analysis

In reflecting upon my trading performance throughout the year, it's evident that my strategy yielded a respectable return of 82.90% in 2023. However, a more nuanced analysis reveals intriguing insights when compared to market benchmarks. Notably, SPXL and SPY delivered returns of 65.04% and 23.66%, respectively. It's crucial to acknowledge that my strategy incorporates a 4x leverage on SPY, implying an anticipated return ranging from 85% to 95% based on the underlying asset's performance. Despite this, it appears that my strategy fell slightly short of expectations, signaling an underperformance relative to a straightforward buy-and-hold approach.

The backdrop of a remarkably robust market in the past year has undoubtedly influenced these outcomes. My strategy, anchored in a disciplined approach to minimizing losses, inherently tends to underperform during exceptionally bullish periods. While the broader market thrived, the strength of my strategy lay in its ability to navigate turbulent waters and weather downturns efficiently.

Moreover, a comprehensive evaluation must extend beyond raw returns to consider the impact of taxes on overall profitability. Unlike a simple buy-and-hold strategy with SPXL or SPY, my day trading approach necessitates accounting for tax liabilities. This key distinction becomes apparent when factoring in tax rates ranging from 10% to 37%, resulting in an adjusted return that varies between 74.61% (with a 10% tax rate) and 52.23% (with a 37% tax rate).

In light of these considerations, the adjusted returns suggest that my strategy, incorporating taxes, falls slightly behind the straightforward alternative of holding SPXL throughout the year. However, it is crucial to recognize the contextual dynamics at play. This particular year, marked by an exceptionally bullish market, may not align perfectly with the strengths of my strategy, which excels in risk mitigation and capital preservation.

In essence, while acknowledging the impact of taxes on returns, it's important to recognize that the observed underperformance might be inherent to the strategic approach rather than a definitive measure of its overall efficacy. The true litmus test of any trading strategy lies not just in absolute returns but in its ability to adapt to diverse market conditions, and this year's extraordinary bullishness may not be the ideal yardstick for evaluating its full potential.
