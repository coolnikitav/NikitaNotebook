# Short SPY Swing Trade

## Results
Did not enter the trade. SPY did not follow the setup. The day after this post was made, SPY held up above above the support line. Then, it broke through the resistance after hours. I was expecting an entry the following day. However, the stock bounced back with great volume and trended until the next resistance.

## Background
There are various waves to determine if one should get into a trade. They are usually divided between fundamental and technical analysis. It is best to use both. Fundamental analysis help determine direction and reason for the move. Technical analysis helps determine entry and exit points.

## Idea
I will be entering into a short trade on SPY on my paper account.

## Reasoning
It can be seen that SPY has just broken through a recent resistance on the chart below.

*SPY breaking through a resistance (10/25/2022)*

This may look like a buy signal for a lot of traders. However, the volume was quite low during this break, indicating a weak move. The volume for the past three days have been decreasing, as seen on the chart below.

*SPY volume levels*

When trading a breakout, I have found that usually you want strong volume that shows interest in people buy the stock and pushing it higher. In the following two setups on SPY, volume was clearly higher on breakout days. Both of those breakouts were followed by a bullish run.

Additionally, both MSFT and GOOG missed their expectations and plunged 6% to start off the earnings season. As market leaders, they will set a bearish tone for the next few weeks. Many traders and investors will react to negative news very negatively and brush off positive news.

Combining a rough earnings season with a fake breakout, which is not supported by volume, creates an environment for a large downside and low upside. Thus, this trade should have good expected value.

## Entry/Exit Points
As seen in the chart below, I am planning on entering the trade when SPY breaks through the support. The stoploss will be set above the nearest high and take profit will be set a bit before the nearest low.

*Short SPY Trade Setup*

The trade has about a 1:2 risk/reward ratio. It need to be profitable 33% of the time to break even. Maximum loss in this trade is 1.79% and maximum gain is 3.84%. In order to amplify the result, I will use a 2x leverage for a max loss of 3.6% and max gain of 7.7%. This is within my risk tolerance (many experienced traders say not to lose more than 5% on a trade).
