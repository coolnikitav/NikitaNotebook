# Results (as of 11/12/2022)
This trade was executed on October 12. It is down $877. I am not sure hot to convert it into percentage loss, since both long and short values were $10000 (thus a $0 net position).

VGK is performing better than S&P500. It might be due to the fact that VGK was shorted in the middle of bad news wave. Thus, it was already at a very low value, having more upside potential than S&P500. I am planning on holding this trade until February to see how winter impacts the European market and their energy crisis.

# Background
“When you are making trades, you should be gaining or losing money based on your analysis and your decision, not because the market moved in your direction or against you.” This was a lesson I learned from my friend, who is an experienced portfolio manager and head of various asset management divisions.

Spread trades accomplish just that. If you think that Apple will outperform the market, you might want to enter a long Apple position. However, if the market falls 30% and Apple falls 20%, you will lose money, even though the prediction was correct. Now, if you long Apple and short Samsung (because you think they will lose market share due to Apple’s great performance), you make money regardless of the direction of the market if you are correct, and lose money regardless of the direction of the market if you are incorrect.

Another place I heard about spread trades was on the All-In podcast. Last year, Chamath was discussing the long Google/Microsoft, short Apple/Facebook/Amazon/Netflix spread. It was a very successful trade, as Google and Microsoft outperformed the other Big Tech companies and the investor had a considerable return when the market was down, as well as a good return when it was up.

# Idea
My theory is that the European market will perform considerably worse than the US market over the next 12-18 month, as the economic situation in Europe is deteriorating at a rapid pace.

Using my paper trading account, I am buying $10000 of SPY and shorting $10000 of VGK. SPY is an ETF that capture the US market. VGK is an ETF that captures the European market. They have very similar volatilities. Thus, I am opening a position for similar amounts.

I am looking for about a 20% move of the position. Since account has $100000, it would be a 2% move, which is low risk position.

# Reasoning
## Energy Crisis
Europe is heavily troubled by its energy crisis. Even though energy costs are down to 150 Euro per megawatt-hour from August high of 350, they are still almost 4 times higher than they were a year ago ([Source](https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2022/10/10/europes-gas-prices-reach-three-month-low-as-consumer-demand-and-industrial-production-decl)). The main concern is how and will Europe get through the upcoming winter. Energy costs are higher during that season. If the winter is colder than usual, or if imports from Russia stop, there is a high chance that gas will become scarce by March 2023 ([Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/10/5/infographic-does-europe-have-enough-gas-for-winter)).

## Russia – Ukraine War
Everyone has been hoping for a diplomatic solution to this conflict. It would end the war, save many lives, and give peace of mind to millions of people. Recent events are not following this resolution: Ukraine blowing up the Crimea bridge and Russia blowing up Ukrainian power stations as revenge. These actions escalate the conflict and open up room for violent actions, such as US supporting Ukraine to hit Russia back, or even the use of nuclear weapons. After these recent events, the future is looking more grim, as it puts a greater number of people at risk. Additionally, if the conflict escalates even further, Russia can stop its gas exports to Europe, which would drive energy prices even hire.\

## Transfer of Production to US
With rising prices, some companies are shifting their manufacturing from Europe to the US ([Source](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/commodities/europe-natural-gas-prices-energy-crisis-manufacturing-work-shift-us-2022-9)). European steelmaker ArcelorMittal and chemical company OCI are cutting a part of their production in Europe and moving it to Texas. Volkswagen and Pandora have expanded into the US. Additionally, has paused its plans to manufacture batteries in Germany. If energy prices rise even further, more companies will be forced to either pause production, increase their prices, or shift manufacturing to the US. This would either benefit the US economy or damage the UK economy even further. Both of the outcomes are favorable for the trade.

# Strengths
I think that it is a low risk trade. The most likely outcomes are the ones where US gains and Europe loses, both of them lose but Europe loses a lot more, or both US and Europe stay about the same (if the energy crisis is averted and war is resolved). Thus, the trade either makes money or doesn’t move much. However, there is still a chance that the European market outperforms the American one.

# Risks
This analysis is based on public information. Thus, there is no special insight. All of these news might already be priced into the price of the ETFs used for this trade. Additionally, I do not yet know methods to evaluate how well an ETF is valued.
