## Analysis

September still stands to be historically the worst month for the stock market. My strategy has a 4x leverage on SPY, it only performed 2.8
times worse. On the other hand, SPXL, which has a 3x leverage on SPY, performed 3.7 times worse. Thus, I consider this quarter relatively successful.
