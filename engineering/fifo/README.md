# 16B FIFO Memory Buffer Design + Verification

## Design
I have designed a FIFO memory buffer, capable of holding 16 8-bit elements. It supports a read and write modes.

The FIFO utilizes a pointer-based system to manage its internal storage.

Code: [fifo.v](https://github.com/coolnikitav/nikitas-notebook/blob/main/engineering/fifo/fifo.v)
